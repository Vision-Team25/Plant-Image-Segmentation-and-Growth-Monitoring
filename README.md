# Plant-Image-Segmentation-and-Growth-Monitoring

## Description
This project focuses on segmenting plant images to monitor growth parameters such as **leaf count, plant health, and height estimation** using OpenCV in C.

## Algorithm Steps
1. **Image Preprocessing**  
   - Convert to grayscale.  
   - Apply contrast enhancement and noise reduction.

2. **Segmentation**  
   - Use **thresholding**, **edge detection**, and **morphological operations** to isolate the plant.

3. **Leaf Counting**  
   - Detect plant leaves using **contour detection** and **connected components analysis**.

4. **Health Analysis**  
   - Analyze **color variations** in the plant region to detect stress or disease.

5. **Height Estimation**  
   - Use **bounding box detection** to measure plant height.
